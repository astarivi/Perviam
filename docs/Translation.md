# Translation and Localization

Is Perviam not available in your language? Not to worryâ€”Perviam can be translated to any language, and even better, translations can be contributed back to help others save time during setup.

## Creating a Translation

To begin your translation, find the [IETF BCP 47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) language tag for your target language. Prefer [broader tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), such as `en` over `en-CA`, whenever possible.

With your target language tag in mind, create a new entry in the Resource Bundle `Messages`, located at `perviam/src/main/resources`. For example:
- `perviam/src/main/resources/Messages_fr.properties` for a French translation.
- `perviam/src/main/resources/Messages_fr-CA.properties` for Canadian French.

This file will contain seven lines, each with a single message, formatted as `key=value`. Below are the required keys and their meanings:

### `placeholder`
This is the placeholder Perviam uses when the target location couldn't be resolved.

- **Example**: `placeholder=Unknown address`

### `unknown_street`
This placeholder is used when a target street has no name, but intersects with other streets that provide enough data for naming.

Set this value to the most common, general term for a "road" in the target language. If multiple terms are available, such as "road" and "street," choose the one that applies broadly to both urban and rural scenarios.

- **Example**: `unknown_street=Road`

### `address_between_two`
This key is used when the resolved street address is between two other streets. For example:

![A street between two other streets](res/address_between_two.png)

The black pin represents the target location on "North Kensington Street" (green), which is between "6th Street North" and "5th Street North" (blue).

**Parameters:**
- `{0}`: Target street (e.g., "North Kensington Street").
- `{1}`: First intersecting street (e.g., "6th Street North").
- `{2}`: Second intersecting street (e.g., "5th Street North").

**Example:**
- `address_between_two={0} between {1} and {2}` would produce:
  *"North Kensington Street between 6th Street North and 5th Street North"*

### `address_between_one`
This key is used when the resolved address intersects only one street in the opposite axis.

**Parameters:**
- `{0}`: Target street.
- `{1}`: Intersecting street.

**Example:**
- `address_between_one={0} at {1}` would produce:
  *"North Kensington Street at 6th Street North"*

### `address_lone`
This key is used when only the current street is found, with no intersections.

**Parameter:**
- `{0}`: Target street.

**Example:**
- `address_lone={0}` would produce:
  *"North Kensington Street"*

### `street_ref_prefix`
This key is used when the found street has no name, but has an associated number. For example, roads in the [United States Numbered Highway System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Numbered_Highway_System) such as Route 66.

**Parameter:**
- `{0}`: Target road number.

**Example:**
- `street_ref_prefix=Route {0}` would produce:
  *"Route 66"* (when `{0}` is 66).

### `rural_address`
Rural addresses are found outside city boundaries, where intersecting streets are often absent. Instead of referencing street intersections, Perviam uses the nearest landmark.

**Parameters:**
- `{0}`: Target road.
- `{1}`: Formatted distance to the nearest landmark.
- `{2}`: Name of the nearest landmark.

**Example:**
- `rural_address={0} at {1} of {2}` would produce:
  *"Route 66 at 102 miles of Amarillo"*

## Wrapping Up

Once your translation is complete, build Perviam and enable it by setting the `languageCode` configuration value to your language tag.

If everything looks good, feel free to contribute your translation back to the repository for others to use!
